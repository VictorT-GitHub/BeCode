# BeCode bootcamp learning projects

You will find on this repository some projects realized during BeCode bootcamp.
There are frontend and backend projects, mainly JavaScript, feel free to pull and customise any project to learn/exerce web development too! (Some projects are still "in progress")

BeCode is a 7-month intensive IT bootcamp (in Brussels) dedicated to backend and frontend web development.
Active pedagogy and team projects are at the heart of this training.
